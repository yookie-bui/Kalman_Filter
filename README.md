# Kalman_Filter
This repository is part A of an assignment of Robotics course that I took at Unversity of Canterbury.  
This part is about locolizing the position of robot in 1-2 using a number of sensor. I created sensor models, a motion model and a Bayes filter (Parallel filter was designed) to improve the estimate for the robot. <br/>
